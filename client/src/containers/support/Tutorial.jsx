          <h2>YouDescribe Audio Description (AD) Tool Step By Step Instructions</h2>

          <h3>Anatomy of the YouDescribe welcome page.</h3>

          <p>Top: A tool bar along the top (from left to right): YouDescribe Home, Search Box, Recent Descriptions, Wish List, and the Sign In buttons.</p>
          <p>Center section: Thumbnail links to recent videos posted with YouDescribe audio description (AD).</p>
          <p>Bottom: Tool bar links to Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute, Credits, Contact Us, and Support</p>

          <p><strong>Getting Started!</strong></p>
          
          <h3>Logging in:</h3>
          <p>Log in to your account using your Google ID at the top right by clicking the box that says “Signin with Google.” (you must have a google ID to add descriptions, if you don’t have one, an account is free and easy to get at: <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en">https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en</a>) You will be prompted to type in your google address, and password. Once you have logged in, you are ready to start describing, and will be able to save your work.</p>

          <h3>Finding your desired YouTube Video:</h3>

          <p><strong>There are two ways to locate videos!</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Search Box</strong>: If you know what video you are seeking, type the name/description/channel into the search box in the upper tool box, center-left of page. The video must be up at YouTube for you to add description. (If it has not been shared at YouTube, you can create a channel of your own to upload the content you want. Directions supplied <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1646861?hl=en">here</a>. Click through the search results until you find the one you want. Sometimes there are multiple copies of the video- pick the best quality and most official one. For example- a Sesame Street video in HD posted by PBS will be of better quality and most likely be at YouTube longer than one who filmed from the TV screen, and loaded to an obscure YouTube Channel. Click the thumbnail to open a new window and start adding AD.</p>

          <p><strong>Wish List</strong>: YouDescribe keeps a wish list of videos in need of AD. To find something on the wish list, click the Wish List button at the top tool bar, it has a heart next to it. Now you are on the main Wish List page. Videos with more votes for AD are at the top, the latest wish list requests are at the bottom. Select a video to describe from the wish list by clicking the Describe button in the lower right hand corner of the video thumbnail. If you want to vote a video to the top of the wish list queue, click the heart in the lower left hand corner of the video thumbnail. Don’t see anything you like? Try clicking the Load More button, bottom center of page, to see the next page of wish list items. Click the thumbnail to select the video and start adding AD.</p>

          <h3>Adding something to the wish list:</h3>
          <p>At YouDescribe, use the search box. The videos will appear as thumb nails. In the left hand corner of each video on the screen is a heart. Click the heart to add it to the wish list. There is not currently a way to add a video to the wish list if it has been opened in YouDescribe. Try going back to the search results page with the thumbnails, and click the heart icon in the lower left corner.</p>

          <h3>Add Audio Description (AD) to your Video:</h3>
          <p>The Video you want to describe should be in the center of the page. If the video does not already have AD, there will be Add Description button under the video screen and to the right. Click there to add your description. (If that video has AD you have two other buttons available as well-rate Description, and Turn off descriptions. Rate description allows you to rate the describer on that particular video. Turn Off descriptions allows you to stop the AD while you view the video. Videos may have multiple descriptions available). To begin - select Add Description. You can add description to any video- even if it has already been described.</p>

          <h3>Anatomy of the YouDescribe AD tools.</h3>
          <p>The video is in the upper left corner with standard YouTube play pause buttons. Stop/start is controlled by the standard YouTube tool bar on the video in the left hand corner. On the right is a section labeled Notes. Under the video is a long tool bar. At the far left of the tool bar are two buttons, a yellow Add Inline button, and a magenta Add extended. Inline is an audio track that plays over the video, it needs to be timed so as not to disrupt the dialog, and original audio. Extended description stops the video while the AD is played. Even with extended description, it is best to say only as much as it strictly necessary so the viewer can get back to watching the video. You will need to be familiar with both the YouTube play/pause buttons, as well as the YouDescribe tool bars.</p>

          <h3>Make an anchor track:</h3>
          <p>To begin, we recommend you record an anchor track. YouDescribe works best if you record a short extended or inline audio track before you proceed to other steps. Often it is the title shown on the screen, or a brief description of the setting.</p>

          <p>Click the Add extended, a space will appear so you can label your first track. Pick something brief but descriptive for each track title, it makes finding the tracks, and editing easier later. Under the label box there are two symbols- a red record button, and a trash can. Mouse up to the controls on the video, and press play. Get the curser ready to click the red record button under the Extended audio track you have set up. When you want to record your first track, click the red record button. Once you have clicked the red button, it will be replaced with a white square. This is now the stop recording button. Click the white square when you are done speaking. Use the control buttons on the video to back up and hear your first track. If you are happy with it, press the save button. To delete a recorded track, click the trash can button. Now you can re-record your anchor track. Once you are happy with it, press save. It is best practice not to delete your anchor track once you are satisfied.</p>

          <h3>Deleting a track:</h3>
          <p>Click the trashcan symbol under the track. Easy! A note of caution, once deleted one cannot bring the track back.</p>

          <h3>Using the Notes section:</h3>
          <p>Now watch the entire video and make your notes for each track in the section to the right of the video. Be brief, be descriptive. Please read anything printed. A full tutorial on good audio description can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24Pmmo9wKik&amplist=PLNJrbI_nyy9uzywoJfyDRoeKA1SaIEFJ7">here</a>. Once you have all your notes written start recording! Pick either inline or extended, and follow the steps above.</p>

          <h3>Saving your work:</h3>
          <p>Save your work often. The save button is on the right hand side, towards the bottom of the audio tracks. Click that save button before you delete anything, or refresh the video.</p>

          <h3>Tool bar for recorded tracks:</h3>
          <p>Under each recorded audio track is a tool bar with 5 functions: a start/stop button (shown as play/pause), a switch between inline and extended track (shown as the Rightwards Arrow Over Leftwards Arrow), left arrow (move the audio track a little earlier), right arrow (move the audio track a little later) and a delete button (classic trash can).</p>

          <p><strong>Editing</strong>:</p>

          <h3>Converting Inline/Extended:</h3>
          <p>You can use a mix of inline and extended audio tracks, and they can be converted from Extended to Inline using the rightwards arrow over leftwards arrow under each track.</p>

          <h3>Using the Nudge feature:</h3>
          <p>To move the track half a second sooner, click the left arrow button, to move it half a second later click the right arrow button. You can click it as many times as you need to get it to settle in exactly the right spot. Play the video to hear if it is just right by using the control panel located on the video (the regular YouTube controls), then save your work by pressing the save button in the lower right corner. Save your work often.</p>

          <p><strong>Troubleshooting your recordings:</strong></p>
          
          <h3>Q: I am playing the video back, but my audio is not playing.</h3>
          <p>A: First of all, make sure that your mic is turned on, your computer’s mic settings are un-muted, and the mic volume is turned up. You can test you mic using a number of online programs. <a href="https://www.onlinemictest.com/">Here is one</a>. YouTube and YouDescribe are sometimes misaligned and the tracks play out of sync, especially if you have used the delete, nudge, or inline/extended edit tools. They are usually still there! Save your work by pressing the save button, then refresh the page - your tracks should now play. If you are on a very slow connection, or are running a lot of programs sometimes there is a lag in processing and saving your tracks. One thing that can help is shutting down any unneeded applications, getting to a better internet or waiting a few more seconds after pressing save before moving onto the next task.</p>

          <h3>Q: My audio track is just a little off, is there anything I can do?</h3>
          <p>A: This is where the nudge feature is your friend. Click the left or right arrows to move it 0.15 seconds sooner or later.</p>

          <h3>Q: What is the difference between inline description and extended description again?</h3>
          <p>A: Most description that has been created over the last few decades is Inline description. This means that the description is carefully dubbed into available spaces in the existing soundtrack. This sometimes left very little space for a describer to say anything, leading to extremely hard choices about what they could describe. With streaming video available on demand, it is no longer necessary to restrict the available time for description. Extended description automatically pauses the video to give the describer as much time as necessary to tell the blind viewer what is going on. Of course, even with extended description, it is best to say only as much as it strictly necessary so you can get back to watching the video.</p>

          <h3>Q: I recorded an inline track but it is too long and is getting in the way of the dialog. Help!</h3>
          <p>A: Try converting it to extended using the double arrow button under the track, then the video will stop so you can get your script in there. If it is too long, you might want to delete it and re-record another one with a shorter description.</p>

          <h3>Q: I made a lot of extended tracks an now the video is super long, and boring.</h3>
          <p>A: It happens to the best of us. We want to be thorough and get everything in there! Chances are the video is a little over described. Try cutting down your script, and re-recording a few tracks.</p>

          <h3>Q: I missed a section I needed to describe, how do I fix it?</h3>
          <p>A: Save your work, then refresh the video so you can play it from the beginning. At the bottom, label the track you want to record. Advance the video until you are in the right spot and click the red dot to start recording, click the white square when you are finished speaking. The tag for the track will not be in play order, but it will play in the correct spot on the video.</p>

          <h3>Q: How long will my content be saved on YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: Your descriptions will be stored on YouDescribe until you delete them.</p>

          <h3>Q: Can I download my descriptions for my own use off-line?</h3>
          <p>A: This feature is not currently available, but stay tuned for possible developments in this area.</p>

          <h3>Q: Can I edit descriptions recorded by other users?</h3>
          <p>A: No, (and they can’t edit yours either). However, you can record a new description of your own for that video. Then users will have access to both descriptions and can choose which one they want.</p>

          <h3>Q: How long will my content be saved on YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: Your descriptions will be stored on YouDescribe until you delete them.</p>

          <h3>Q: How can I send feedback or reach technical support?</h3>
          <p>A: Please email us at: <a href="mailto: info@youdescribe.org">info@youdescribe.org</a> or join our online community at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/youdescribe/">Facebook</a>.</p>
