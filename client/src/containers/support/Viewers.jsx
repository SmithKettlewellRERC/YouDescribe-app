          <h3>Anatomy of the YouDescribe welcome page</h3>
          <p>
            Top: A tool bar along the top (from left to right): YouDescribe
            Home, Search Box, Recent Descriptions, Wish List, and the Sign In
            buttons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Center section: Thumbnail links to recent videos posted with
            YouDescribe audio description (AD).
          </p>
          <p>
            Bottom: Tool bar links to Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute,
            Credits, Contact Us, and Support.
          </p>

          <h3>Q: How can I find YouTube videos that have descriptions?</h3>
          <p>
            A: There are two ways to locate videos! Both require you to visit{" "}
            <a href="www.youdescribe.org">www.youdescribe.org</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Search Box:</strong> If you know what video you are seeking,
            type the name/description/key word into the search box in the upper
            tool bar. Click through the search results until you find the one
            you want. Described videos are listed first, then those without AD.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Browse:</strong> Recently described videos are in the center
            section of the homepage, newly posted first. One can load more by
            clicking the Load More button.
          </p>

          <h3>Q: Can I request a description for a particular video?</h3>
          <p>
            A: Yes! YouDescribe keeps a Wish List of videos in need of AD. At{" "}
            <a href="www.youdescribe.org">www.youdescribe.org</a>, use the
            search box (top tool bar, center left). The videos will appear as
            thumb nails. In the left hand corner of each video on the screen is
            a heart. Click the heart to add it to the wish list. Videos with
            more votes for AD are at the top, the latest wish list requests are
            at the bottom. If you want to vote a video to the top of the wish
            list queue, click the icon in the lower left hand corner of the
            video thumbnail. There is not currently a way to add a video to the
            wish list if it has been opened in YouDescribe. Try going back to
            the search results page with the thumbnails, and click the icon in
            the lower left corner. Not finding anything you like? Try clicking
            the Load More button, bottom center of page, to see the next page of
            Wish List items.
          </p>

          <h3>Q: Can I rewind and fast-forward and stuff like that?</h3>
          <p>
            A: Of course! The YouDescribe player frame includes buttons for
            Stop, Pause/Play, Rewind, and Fast-Forward. A box below and to the
            right of every video allows you to turn off descriptions entirely or
            select from different describers if there is more than one
            description available for the video.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Q: Iâ€™m playing the video but the volume of the video and describer
            is all wrong, how do I fix that?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: There is a slide bar under each video labeled V-- -- -- -- D.
            Slide the bar to the left to have more Video volume, to the right to
            have more Describer volume.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Q: I want someone to add audio description for a video I own, can
            they use YouDescribe?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A: Yes, as long as the video is posted at YouTube. You can create a
            channel of your own to upload the content you want. Directions
