          <h2>About YouDescribe</h2>

          <p>Much of the content here is covered in our YouDescribe playlist: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNJrbI_nyy9sjqZ-Wcn6sX868i9KtdNrT">What is YouDescribe? A video tutorial.</a></p>

          <h3>Q: Is YouDescribe really free?</h3>
          <p>A: Yes! Anyone can play or describe YouTube videos for free using YouDescribe.</p>

          <h3>Q: Who should be using YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: Everyone who supports or needs audio description can use YouDescribe. People with visual disabilities who cannot see what is going on in a video can benefit from descriptions recorded by sighted describers, but other viewers like individuals on the autism spectrum, or those learning a new language can benefit from AD as well. Descriptions can be contributed by anyone with the time, skill, and inclination, including parents, teachers, and friends and fans. Many people may just think YouDescribe is cool and want to try it. </p>

          <h3>Q: What is so important about description?</h3>
          <p>A: In addition to video’s enormous entertainment, and cultural importance, video is being used in more and more educational and employment situations. While videos can sometimes be completely understandable by a blind viewer simply by listening to the sound track, usually there are visual elements that have no audible equivalent. For example, when someone demonstrating a yoga pose says, “Hold your arms like this,” or a crafting demonstrator says, “Glue this piece like this,” the blind viewer is barred from using that video as a learning tool. On-screen text, scene changes, and body language are all video elements that may need some description in order for a blind viewer to follow a story. Adding description makes video accessible. That’s important!</p>

          <h3>Q: What’s so cool about YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: YouDescribe is unique in that it allows anybody, anywhere to contribute description of an existing video and let a visually-impaired viewer check it out right away. The best part is that it does so without modifying or redistributing the existing YouTube video. It is not a separate version, it’s the same version with description added while you watch.</p>

          <h3>Q: How does YouDescribe work?</h3>
          <p>A: Sighted people view YouTube videos and record descriptions of what they see. When the video is played with YouDescribe, the descriptions are played back with the video. Underneath the hood, YouDescribe uses an exclusive API to store description clips and information about them. YouDescribe knows what video each clip belongs to and what time the clip should be played. Lots of other information is stored along with the descriptions, including who recorded it, when it was recorded, how popular it is, etc. YouDescribe is the first video service to allow anybody, anywhere, to record and upload video descriptions to the cloud. It provides a unique way for people to get descriptions for the instructional, informational, and entertainment videos offered on YouTube.</p>

          <h3>Q: Can YouDescribe be used for videos other than those on YouTube?</h3>
          <p>A: No. The video must be up at YouTube for you to add description. If it has not been shared at YouTube, you can create a channel of your own to upload the content you want.

          <h3>Q: Who built YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: The Smith-Kettlewell Video Description Research and Development Center developed the Descriptive Video Exchange and YouDescribe. YouDescribe was developed in collaboration with The Ideal Group and the Description Leadership Network.</p>

          <h3>Q: How do I play a described video with YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: To play a YouDescribe video, you do not need to be logged in. Simply go to the main search page of YouDescribe and click on the title of any of the videos listed. The most recently described videos appear at the top of the list. Find any video by using the search field on this page. While videos with descriptions are listed first, search results will yield undescribed videos as well. Just click on the title to play the video you want to watch.</p>

          <h3>Q: How do I become a registered YouDescribe user?</h3>
          <p>A: Becoming a registered user allows you to rate descriptions, and create your own! Log in to your account using a Google ID (you must have a google ID to rate and add descriptions. If you don’t have a Google ID, an account is free and easy to get at: <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en">https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en</a>). At www.youdescribe.org you will be prompted to type in your google address, and password. Once you have logged in, you are ready to start rating videos, and doing audio description (AD).</p>

          <h3>Q: What browsers are compatible with YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: YouDescribe works with most browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. (Chrome tends to work best, especially if the internet connection is slow).</p>

          <h3>Q: What operating systems are compatible with YouDescribe?</h3>
          <p>A: YouDescribe is compatible with any Mac or PC-based operating system. Currently, YouDescribe is not compatible on mobile devices but they are in the works and will be launched very soon.</p>

          <h3>Q: How do I share a described video with a friend or embed it in a webpage?</h3>
          <p>A: Sharing can be done in a couple of ways. On the left of every video is a quick share link for email, Facebook, and twitter. It generates an easy to share template for each social media platform. To share on a webpage one can copy the web address from the browser field at the top and use iframe or an object tag to embed the desired video.</p>

          <h3>Q: How can I send feedback or reach technical support?</h3>
